- Long press volume keys to skip tracks
- Lockscreen album art has been disabled
- Quick settings tiles now vibrate when you tap them
- Peek has been disabled for easier knock-off
- Allow [KDE Connect](https://kdeconnect.kde.org/) to access the clipboard in the background
- Enable rotating the phone upside down
- Long-press the Google Assistant key to toggle the flashlight
- `FLAG_SECURE` is disabled globally. Screenshot any app you want!
- The contents of specific apps have been hidden from recents. This does not mean they have `FLAG_SECURE` though, this only affects recents. You can still screenshot them.
